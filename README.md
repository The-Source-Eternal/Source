The Source Eternal aims to be an open source puzzle/adventure web-based game that teaches coding by teaching game-making. We are currently prototyping our own open source engine using three.js and a couple of other libraries and borrowing code from a few more. We hope we can build a more intuitive interface for manipulating objects and one that is available in the browser.
