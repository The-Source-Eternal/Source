The Source Eternal aims to be an open source puzzle/adventure web-based game to demistify programming and game-making. We are currently prototyping our own open source engine using three.js and a couple of other libraries and borrowing code from a few more. We hope we can build a more intuitive interface for manipulating objects and one that is available in the browser.

You will need to have webGL capabilities to view the demo. You can check if you have webGL here: http://get.webgl.org
